## OBJECTIVES
  + I’m looking to join a company which contributes back to the world, whether it be through contributions to non-profit organizations or open source projects.


----
## INTERESTS and QUALIFICATIONS
  + Extensive management experience with BSD/UNIX and GNU/Linux operating systems, containerization (including Kubernetes, Docker, and Jails), DevOps automation, and Continuous Integration.

  + Created dev and test environments off different applications by provisioning k8s clusters on AWS using Jenkins, Terraform, Ansible, and Docker.

  + In depth knowledge of AWS cloud infrastructure, including EKS, and some exposure to Google Cloud.

  + One of my passions is metrics, monitoring, and security.  Leveraging Prometheus and Grafana, and Elasticsearch for security auditing and performance analysis or the basis of platform autoscaling.

  + Implemented Jenkins CI/CD concepts, jobs, builds, pipelines, triggering, testing, distributed, builds, artifacts, and PaaS model for engineering teams using Terraform with Infrastructure-as-code.

  + Experienced with Amazon AWS cloud administration services like: EC2, S3 EBS, VPC, ALB, AMI, SNS, RDS, IAM, Route53, Cloudfront, Cloudwatch, Cloudtrail, Cloudformation (inc. eksctl), Elasticache.

  + I prefer internally managed services (eg. Gitlab) over cloud-provided for security, privacy, and customization/control.

  + CD best practices like distributed builds, containerization, traceability, high availability, and auto repository builds

  + Knows: Terraform, Helm, Ansible, Python, Bash, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, YAML

  + Prefers: VIM with spaces (not tabs) and Zsh.

  + Capable: Golang, PHP, JAVA, Jenkins, VPN networking, Routing and Switching, and VPN administration.

  + Outside work I like to spend my time building Keyboards, Quadcopters, IoT hardware or sensors, Wireless (mesh networking), and most things involving ARM processors.

  + More passions: nuclear power, net neutrality / free speech, and Home Automation.
