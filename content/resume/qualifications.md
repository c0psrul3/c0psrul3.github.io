+ I have in depth knowledge of AWS cloud infrastructure, including EKS, and some exposure to Google Cloud.

+ Implemented Jenkins CI/CD concepts, jobs, builds, pipelines, triggering, testing, distributed, builds, artifacts, and PaaS model for engineering teams using Terraform with Infrastructure-as-code.

+ Experienced with Amazon AWS cloud administration services like: EC2, S3 EBS, VPC, ALB, AMI, SNS, RDS, IAM, Route53, Cloudfront, Cloudwatch, Cloudtrail, Cloudformation (inc. eksctl), Elasticache.

+ I prefer internally managed services (eg. Gitlab) over cloud-provided for security, privacy, and customization/control.
